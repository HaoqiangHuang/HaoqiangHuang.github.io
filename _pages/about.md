I am a fourth-year PhD student at CSE department, HKUST. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Siu-Wing Cheng](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~scheng/).  Previously, I was an undergraduate student in computer science and technology at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science. My current research interests lie in computational geometry and especially the algorithmic problems motivated by data mining on trajectories and time series.
